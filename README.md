# odin-recipes
This is my first assignment with Odin Project. I learned how to create a repository, clone the repo to my local machine, staging and and making a commit in order to save changes. I've also learned how to open files in VS Code using the code . command. 
I learned how to create first webpage using a boilerplate where I learned of tags, elements, and how to format them.
